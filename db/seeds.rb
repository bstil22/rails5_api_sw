    The planet is not far from the Corellian Run. It has its own navigation system. However, it still plays a role in galactic events, serving as the home of Anakin Skywalker. It was here that Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn recognized Anakin's potential to become a Jedi and where he introduced him to Obi-Wan Kenobi, his future master and mentor. Tatooine is also the home of Anakin's son, Luke, where he lived until his early adulthood.
    The planet has acquired a bad reputation, often being viewed as the cesspool of the galaxy due to the large number of criminals who could be found there."

    description: "Dathomir is an obscure planet in the Outer Rim Territories, located in the Quelii sector.
    It is somewhat smaller than Coruscant in size, and has slightly-below-standard gravity, but the planetary day is close to standard, and the planetary year is long, lasting 491 days. Dathomir has four moons.
    Dathomir is considered a temperate and beautiful planet by Human standards, with a varied terrain that includes coastal lakes and tar-pits, thick forests and snow-capped mountain peaks, powerful rivers and broad savannas, small icecaps and dramatic rift valleys.
    Even under the New Republic, however, nine-tenths of the planet remains unexplored and uninhabited, with the population limited to a relatively small area along the edge of one of the three main continents, a zone of uplands and river plains bounded on one side by the unsailed ocean and on the other by vast expanses of desert."

It has little or no surface water except for patches of water ice on the night side.
    It is a planet of extremes: dry, rocky landscapes of deserts, mountain ranges with mist-covered peaks, shadowy valleys, alternated with snowy wastes, joined by lush temperate bands which concentrate much of its population"

    description: "Vulpter is the third planet of the Vulpter system in the Deep Core, and the homeworld of the sentient Vulptereen species.
    Originally an unspoiled world with a wide array of flora and fauna, Vulpter has been transformed over the millennia into a massively polluted globe covered in waste and factories.
    This means that the planet was unable to sustain itself in terms of agriculture, and was thus entirely reliant on importing foodstuffs from other worlds.
    Vulpter is a noted producer of starships, and is home to one of the galaxy's largest podracer factories.
    Several corporations, such as Viper Sensor Intelligence Systems and Arakyd Industries, operated facilities on the planet.
    Vulpter became part of the galactic community at large between 20,000 and 15,000 BBY. The Vulptereens were among the founding members of the Trade Federation, an allegiance that proved catastrophic for Vulpter's ecosystem.
    When the Federation seized control of the planet, the organization essentially turned the already-polluted world into an enormous junkyard.
    Following the establishment of the Galactic Empire, Vulpter was blockaded and cut off from all interplanetary trade, leading to widespread famine on the planet.
    It was not until the establishment of the New Republic that Vulpter rejoined the galaxy"
